Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page. Feel free to poke around and see some of the projects I've been working on.

Not sure where to start? Pick one of the following repositories:

* For high-performance audio processing and embedded programming in Rust, explore [CyberGrape](https://sgilfeather.github.io/CyberGrape/cybergrape/)
* For generalization through client/server models and inter-process communication in Python, take a look at the [MEDFORD Language Server](https://github.com/TuftsBCB/medford-language-server)
* For profiled high-performance projects in C interacting with computer architecture, explore my work for [COMP 40](https://github.com/liam-strand/comp40): Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming
* For concurrenct traffic simulations in Erlang, try my [final project](https://github.com/liam-strand/cs-21-final-project) for CS 21: Concurrent Programming

I hope you like what you see! Feel free to reach out via email with any questions.

Best,\
Liam
